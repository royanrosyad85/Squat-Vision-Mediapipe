# Squat Analysis using MediaPipe

A real-time AI-powered system for analyzing squat form and posture using MediaPipe pose estimation. This application offers feedback on your squat technique and evaluates pose estimation accuracy using MPJPE metrics.

## Features

### Squat Analysis
- **Real-time form detection**: Analyze squat form during a workout
- **Video upload**: Upload and analyze recorded videos
- **Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on correct/incorrect form
- **Customizable modes**: Beginner and Pro settings available

### MPJPE Evaluation
- **Mean Per Joint Position Error**: Evaluate pose estimation accuracy 
- **Joint-wise analysis**: Detailed error analysis for individual joints
- **Real-time visualization**: View error metrics during pose estimation
- **Comparison view**: Option to visualize the difference between predicted and ground truth landmarks

## Key Landmarks for MPJPE Evaluation

The MPJPE evaluation focuses on the following key landmarks:
- Shoulder (landmark_id: 11)
- Elbow (landmark_id: 13)
- Wrist (landmark_id: 15)
- Hip (landmark_id: 23)
- Knee (landmark_id: 25)
- Ankle (landmark_id: 27)
- Foot (landmark_id: 31)

## How MPJPE is Calculated

The Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) is calculated as the average Euclidean distance between the predicted joint positions and the ground truth positions:

MPJPE = (1/N) * Œ£ ||P_i - GT_i||_2

Where:
- N is the number of joints being evaluated
- P_i is the predicted position of joint i
- GT_i is the ground truth position of joint i
- ||.||_2 represents the Euclidean distance

## Interpreting MPJPE Values

- **< 5 pixels**: Excellent accuracy
- **5-10 pixels**: Good accuracy, suitable for most applications
- **> 10 pixels**: Needs improvement, may require better conditions or calibration
